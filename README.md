##Summary
The visualization is a box-and-whisker plot that summarizes the distribution of home runs by baseball player's batting stance. The visualization displays the 25th quartile, the median, the 75th quartile, and the upper and lower fences, which are the maximum and minimum excluding outliers, which are colored salmon. Hover over the outliers to display the player's name and his career number of home runs.   

##Design
My chart type was a box-and-whisker plot.  The box-and-whisker plot was chosen because of its simplicity and wealth of information that it depicts.  The visual encodings were developed by the mathematican John Tukey, a professional.  I encoded the outliers salmon to bring attention to them against the white space and distribution boxes below.  The layout was chosen to demonstrate the difference among the batting stances.

##What do you notice in the visualization?
I notice the red dots on top first. Then, I notice the difference of the hieght of each box that corresponds to each handedness label. 

###What questions do you have about the data?
Over what period of time was this data collected? Does the data represent professional Baseball players records? Does each dot represent one batter?

###What relationships do you notice?
There seem to be a wider range or lefthanded homerun outcomes. Left handers score more home runs. Is that because there are more left-handers? 

###What do you think is the main takeaway from this visualization?
Lefties are better batters.

###Is there something you donâ€™t understand in the graphic?
What does the height of the box represent? What does the height of the top bar represent? Do the red dots represent statistical outliers?

###How would you improve the visualization?
It would be nice if when I hovered over the outliers there was more information about the Player: a photo, team, the years of their career. It would make the chart more rewarding to interact with, more fun.
