###Summary
The visualization is a box-and-whisker plot that summarizes the distribution of home runs by how a baseball player bats. The visualization displays the 25th quartile, the median, the 75th quartile, and the upper and lower fences, which are the maximum and minimum excluding outliers, which are colored salmon. Truly exceptional players, outliers in this data set, are discoverable by hovering over the outliers to display the player's name and his career number of home runs.   

###Design
My chart type was a box-and-whisker plot.  The box-and-whisker plot was chosen because of its simplicity and the wealth of information that it depicts.  The visual encodings were developed by the mathematican John Tukey, a professional.  I encoded the outliers a salmon-color to bring attention to them against the white space and distribution boxes below.  The layout was chosen to demonstrate the difference among the batting stances.

*What do you notice in the visualization?*
I notice the red dots on top first. Then, I notice the difference of the height of each box that corresponds to each handedness label. 

*What questions do you have about the data?*
Over what period of time was this data collected? Does the data represent professional Baseball players records? Does each dot represent one batter?

*What relationships do you notice?*
There seem to be a wider range or lefthanded homerun outcomes. Left handers score more home runs. Is that because there are more left-handers? 

*What do you think is the main takeaway from this visualization?*
Lefties are better batters.

*Is there something you donâ€™t understand in the graphic?*
What does the height of the box represent? What does the height of the top bar represent? Do the red dots represent statistical outliers?

*How would you improve the visualization?*
It would be nice if when I hovered over the outliers there was more information about the Player: a photo, team, the years of their career. It would make the chart more rewarding to interact with, more fun.

I'm missing an axis title for the x-axis. It explains through reading the title of your graph, but it took me a moment. So maybe it's better to have it right away clear.

I like that you put a hover event on the outliers, makes it a nice little feature to explore the names and numbers.

The hover-event for the boxplot basis boxes is however confusing. They turn red, but it seems for no particular reason. There is no additional information coming from this, and it made me expect it would be clickable or something (but it's not)
You could consider giving them color anyways - or maybe just remove this feature.

Also, this might be your design choice, that we only get to see information about the outliers - the players with especially high amount of homeruns.
This is maybe also okay, but it feels it should be justified somewhere in the text. You could add a little paragraph explaining what you were doing and why so.
